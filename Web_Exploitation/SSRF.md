# 🛰️ SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

## 🔍 What is SSRF?
Server-Side Request Forgery lets an attacker trick the server into sending requests on its behalf — often to internal systems.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
- Burp Suite
- curl
- SSRFmap (exploring automation)

## 🧪 What I Did (TryHackMe - Web Fundamentals)
- Found a form that reflected a URL back to me
- Manipulated input to access target machine (AWS metadata)
- Extracted IAM credentials and other juicy data

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- SSRF is often blind
- Success = Indirect response
- Useful for pivoting into internal networks
- Cloud setups are vulnerable if outbound rules are loose

## 🛡️ Defense Tips
- Validate and sanitize URLs server-side
- Block requests to internal IP ranges
- Use SSRF protections in cloud providers (like AWS IMDSv2)
