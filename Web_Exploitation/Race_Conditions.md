# 🏁 Race Conditions — First Encounter

## 🧠 What I Understood
A race condition occurs when two or more operations are executed in parallel, and one finishes before the system can properly update the database or lock the resource. This allows multiple "successful" executions when only one should have occurred.

The root cause is a **timing flaw** in how web applications handle shared resources, especially across multi-step logic (e.g., validate → apply → recalculate).

## 🔓 Real-World Examples
- Sending two money transfers before the balance updates
- Booking the same table or ticket from two sources
- Applying a coupon twice because the system hasn't flagged it as used yet

---

## 💥 How I Tried to Exploit It
- Intercepted a request in Burp Suite
- Sent 20 copies of it using the Repeater (grouped and sent simultaneously)
- Aim: Exploit the brief time window between validation and application

---

## 🛡️ How to Defend Against Race Conditions
- Use **atomic database operations** (all-or-nothing)
- Lock the record or resource until one request finishes
- Prevent multiple sessions from processing the same resource simultaneously
- Introduce **transaction-level isolation** in business-critical logic

## 🔁 My Reflection
This room was theory-heavy and initially overwhelming. But breaking it down through analogies and hands-on Burp testing helped me understand the core idea.
